    - Maven
    - NuGet
- Abstract Common Packages to Enable Sharing and Reuse
- Inspect Codebase to Identify Code Dependencies that can be Converted to Packages
- Identify and Recommend Standardized Package Types and Versions across the Solution
- Refactor Existing Build Pipelines to implement Version Strategy that Publishes Packages

## Manage Security and Compliance
- Inspect Open Source Software Packages for Security and License Compliance to Align with Corporate Standards, for example:
    - GPLv3
